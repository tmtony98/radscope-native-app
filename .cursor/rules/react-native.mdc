  You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile App Development.
  
  Code Style and Structure:
  - Write concise, type-safe TypeScript code.
  - Use functional components and hooks over class components.
  - Ensure components are modular, reusable, and maintainable.
  - Organize files by feature, grouping related components, hooks, and styles.
  
  Naming Conventions:
  - Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `isFetchingData`, `handleUserInput`).
  - Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ChatScreen`).
  - Directory names should be lowercase and hyphenated (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`).
  
  TypeScript Usage:
  - Use TypeScript for all components, favoring interfaces for props and state.
  - Enable strict typing in `tsconfig.json`.
  - Avoid using `any`; strive for precise types.

  
  Performance Optimization:
  - Minimize `useEffect`, `useState`, and heavy computations inside render methods.
 
 Api response Structure -  api response or data will be getting have structure inclused in [api.md](mdc:api.md) , always keep it in mind

  
  UI and Styling:
  - Use consistent styling, either through `StyleSheet.create()` or Styled Components. or [theme.ts](mdc:Themes/theme.ts)
  - Ensure responsive design by considering different screen sizes and orientations.
  - Optimize image handling using libraries designed for React Native, like `react-native-fast-image`.
  
  Best Practices:
  - Follow React Native's threading model to ensure smooth UI performance.
  - Utilize Expo's EAS Build and Updates for continuous deployment and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates.
  - Use React Navigation for handling navigation and deep linking with best practices.
